        <h2> RK PELISTER</h2>
        <p>

            From the 1983/1984 season Pelister began to participate regularly in the Yugoslav First League.
            Pelister became the first ever Macedonian club to play in Europe, in 1986 against Atlético Madrid BM.
            When the Macedonian League was formed in 1993, Pelister became the most successful club,
            winning the majority of domestic titles in that decade. In 1996,
            they made it to the semi-finals of the EHF Cup Winners' Cup but the club's most successful European run
            was made during the 2001/02 season when they played in the EHF Challenge Cup.
            Pelister  have won six  Macedonian Super League Titles and six Macedonian Handball Cups.
